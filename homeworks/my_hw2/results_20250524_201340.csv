SYN001,what's a quick keto breakfast option,"# Keto Avocado and Eggs

**Cuisine Type:** Keto-Friendly
**Prep Time:** 5 minutes | **Cook Time:** 5 minutes | **Total:** 10 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Serves:** 1 person

## Why This Recipe Works
This dish combines the creaminess of avocado, which is high in healthy fats, with protein-packed eggs. It’s a satisfying, low-carb option to kick-start your day and aligns perfectly with keto dietary guidelines.

## Ingredients
- 1 ripe avocado
- 2 large eggs
- Salt, to taste
- Fresh black pepper, to taste
- Optional: crushed red pepper flakes, fresh herbs (like cilantro or parsley) for garnish

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Avocado:** Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Scoop out a little extra flesh from the center to create a larger well for the egg.
   
2. **Preheat the Pan:** In a non-stick skillet, heat a teaspoon of olive oil or butter over medium heat.

3. **Crack the Eggs:** Gently crack an egg into a small bowl and carefully pour it into one half of the avocado, being cautious not to break the yolk. Repeat with the second egg in the other half.

4. **Cook the Eggs:** Place the avocado halves in the skillet. Cook for about 5-6 minutes, or until the egg white is set but the yolk is still a bit runny, or cook longer if a firmer yolk is preferred.

5. **Season and Serve:** Once cooked, season the eggs with salt and black pepper. Add crushed red pepper flakes or fresh herbs if desired for extra flavor. Serve immediately.

## Pro Tips
- If you want the yolk more cooked, cover the skillet with a lid for 1-2 minutes to help the egg cook evenly.
- Choose a ripe avocado for better flavor and creaminess; it should be slightly soft to the touch.

## Variations
- For extra flavor, you can sprinkle shredded cheese (like cheddar or feta) on top of the eggs before cooking.
- Add cooked bacon or sausage crumbles on top for additional protein and flavor."

## Why This Recipe Works
This dish highlights the fresh flavors of basil pesto paired with grilled chicken over zucchini noodles, making it a satisfying yet low-carb meal. The natural sweetness of zucchini complements the savory notes of the grilled chicken and pesto, resulting in a colorful and nutritious lunch.

## Ingredients
- 2 medium zucchinis
- 1 cup homemade or store-bought basil pesto (ensure gluten-free)
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Optional: cherry tomatoes, halved, for garnish

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Chicken:**  
   Season the chicken breasts with salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Ensure they are evenly coated.
   
2. **Grill the Chicken:**  
   Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 6-7 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C) and have nice grill marks. Set aside to rest for a few minutes before slicing.

3. **Make Zucchini Noodles:**  
   While the chicken is grilling, use a spiralizer or a vegetable peeler to create zucchini noodles. If using a peeler, slice the zucchini into thin, long strips to resemble noodles.

4. **Sauté the Zucchini Noodles:**  
   In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini noodles and sauté for about 2-3 minutes, just until they soften slightly but remain al dente.

## Pro Tips
- To ensure the zucchini noodles don't become watery, avoid overcooking them. Just a quick sauté will keep the texture firm.
- If you want to make your pesto from scratch, blend fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, parmesan cheese, olive oil, and a pinch of salt in a food processor until smooth.

## Variations
- Add grilled shrimp or turkey slices instead of chicken for a different protein source.
- For added flavor, sprinkle some feta cheese on top before serving.

1. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a large bowl, combine olive oil, cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Add the chicken thighs, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and let marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours in the fridge).

2. **Preheat the Grill:** Heat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Make sure it’s hot before adding the chicken to get a nice sear.

3. **Grill the Chicken:** Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it on the grill. Cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has nice grill marks (internal temperature should reach 165°F or 75°C). Remove from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.

4. **Slice the Chicken:** Once rested, slice the chicken into thin strips.

5. **Assemble the Wraps:** Lay a pita or flatbread on a clean surface. Add a handful of shredded lettuce, some diced tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion. Top with a generous portion of sliced chicken and drizzle with tahini or yogurt sauce.

6. **Wrap It Up:** Fold the sides of the pita over the filling and roll it up tightly from the bottom to enclose the filling.

7. **Serve:** Place the wraps on a plate, garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and enjoy your homemade chicken shawarma wraps!

## Pro Tips
- For the juiciest chicken, avoid overcooking by using a meat thermometer.
- Serve with extra tahini or yogurt sauce on the side for dipping.

## Variations
- Substitute chicken with beef or lamb for a different protein choice.
- Add grilled vegetables like peppers and zucchini for added flavor and nutrition.

**Cuisine Type:** Chinese  
**Prep Time:** 15 minutes | **Cook Time:** 10 minutes | **Total:** 25 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Serves:** 4 people  

## Why This Recipe Works
This dish is a vibrant and nutritious option that balances lean protein from the chicken with a colorful array of fresh vegetables. The use of garlic, ginger, and a touch of soy sauce creates an umami flavor without the need for added MSG or excessive salt. The stir-frying method preserves the textures and colors of the ingredients, making it visually appealing and delicious.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb (450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced (or ½ teaspoon ground ginger)
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 medium carrot, sliced thinly
- 2 green onions, chopped (whites and greens separated)
- 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water (for thickening, optional)
- Black pepper, to taste

## Instructions
1. **Prep the Ingredients:** Slice the chicken and vegetables as specified. This helps everything cook quickly and evenly. Have all your ingredients handy before starting to cook.

2. **Heat the Oil:** In a large non-stick skillet or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.

3. **Cook the Chicken:** Add the sliced chicken to the skillet. Stir-fry for about 5-6 minutes until cooked through and lightly browned. To ensure even cooking, avoid overcrowding the pan; you can cook in batches if necessary.

4. **Add Aromatics:** Once the chicken is cooked, add the minced garlic and ginger to the pan. Stir-fry for another 30 seconds until fragrant.

5. **Add Vegetables:** Toss in the bell pepper, broccoli, carrot, and the white parts of the green onions. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp. They should be vibrantly colored.

6. **Season the Stir-Fry:** Pour in the low-sodium soy sauce and rice vinegar. Stir everything well to coat the ingredients in the sauce. If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can add the cornstarch mixture now.

7. **Finish and Serve:** Stir-fry for another minute until the sauce has thickened slightly. Turn off the heat, season with black pepper to taste, and sprinkle the green parts of the green onions on top before serving.

## Pro Tips
- Using fresh vegetables enhances the dish's color and texture while keeping it healthy. Feel free to substitute or add any other seasonal vegetables you prefer!
- To make the chicken extra tender, you can marinate it in a teaspoon of soy sauce and a teaspoon of cornstarch for 15 minutes before cooking.

## Variations
- For a vegetarian version, replace the chicken with firm tofu, pressing it to remove excess moisture, and cut it into cubes.
- If you want to add some spice, consider incorporating sliced chili peppers or a dash of red pepper flakes while cooking."
